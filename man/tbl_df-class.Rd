\title{\code{tbl_df} class}
\description{
The \code{tbl_df} class is a subclass of \code{\link[base:data.frame]{data.frame}},
created in order to have different default behaviour. The colloquial term
"tibble" refers to a data frame that has the \code{tbl_df} class. Tibble is the
central data structure for the set of packages known as the
\href{https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/}{tidyverse}, including
\href{http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/}{dplyr},
\href{http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/}{ggplot2},
\href{http://tidyr.tidyverse.org/}{tidyr}, and
\href{http://readr.tidyverse.org/}{readr}.

The general ethos is that tibbles are lazy and surly: they do less and
complain more than base \link[base:data.frame]{data.frames}. This forces
problems to be tackled earlier and more explicitly, typically leading to code
that is more expressive and robust.

\section{Properties of \code{tbl_df}}{


Objects of class \code{tbl_df} have:
\itemize{
\item A \code{class} attribute of \code{c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame")}.
\item A base type of \code{"list"}, where each element of the list has the same
\code{\link[=NROW]{NROW()}}.
\item A \code{names} attribute that is a character vector the same length as the
underlying list.
\item A \code{row.names} attribute, included for compatibility with the base
\link[base:data.frame]{data.frame class}. However, \code{row.names} are ignored
by most tibble methods.
}
}

\section{Behavior of \code{tbl_df}}{


How default behaviour of tibbles differs from that of
\link[base:data.frame]{data.frames}, during creation and access:
\itemize{
\item Column data is not coerced. A character vector is not turned into a factor.
List-columns are expressly anticipated and do not require special tricks.
Read more in \code{\link[=tibble]{tibble()}}.
\item Recycling only happens for a length 1 input.
\item Column names are not munged, although missing names are auto-populated.
Empty and duplicated column names are strongly discouraged, but the user
must indicate how to resolve. Read more in \link{name-repair}.
\item Row names are not added and are strongly discouraged, in favor of storing
that info as a column. Read about in \link{rownames}.
\item \code{df[, j]} returns a tibble; it does not automatically extract the column
inside. \code{df[, j, drop = FALSE]} is the default. Read more in \link{subsetting}.
\item There is no partial matching when \code{$} is used to index by name. \code{df$name}
for a nonexistent name generates a warning. Read more in \link{subsetting}.
\item Printing and inspection are a very high priority. The goal is to convey as
much information as possible, in a concise way, even for large and complex
tibbles. Read more in \link{formatting}.
