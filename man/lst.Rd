\title{Build a list}
\usage{
lst(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{A set of name-value pairs. Arguments are evaluated sequentially,
so you can refer to previously created elements. These arguments are
processed with \code{\link[rlang:quos]{rlang::quos()}} and support unquote via \code{\link{!!}} and
unquote-splice via \code{\link{!!!}}. Use \code{:=} to create columns that start with a dot.}
}
\value{
A named list.
}
\description{
\Sexpr[results=rd, stage=render]{tibble:::lifecycle("questioning")}

\code{lst()} constructs a list, similar to \code{\link[base:list]{base::list()}}, but with some of the
same features as \code{\link[=tibble]{tibble()}}. \code{lst()} builds components sequentially. When
defining a component, you can refer to components created earlier in the
call. \code{lst()} also generates missing names automatically.
}
\section{Life cycle}{

The \code{lst()} function is in the \href{https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#questioning}{questioning stage}. It is essentially
\code{\link[rlang:list2]{rlang::list2()}}, but with a couple features copied from \code{\link[=tibble]{tibble()}}. It's not
clear that a function for creating lists belongs in the tibble package.
Consider using \code{\link[rlang:list2]{rlang::list2()}} instead.

\examples{
# the value of n can be used immediately in the definition of x
lst(n = 5, x = runif(n))

# missing names are constructed from user's input
lst(1:3, z = letters[4:6], runif(3))

a <- 1:3
b <- letters[4:6]
lst(a, b)

# pre-formed quoted expressions can be used with lst() and then
# unquoted (with !!) or unquoted and spliced (with !!!)
n1 <- 2
n2 <- 3
n_stuff <- quote(n1 + n2)
x_stuff <- quote(seq_len(n))
lst(!!!list(n = n_stuff, x = x_stuff))
lst(n = !!n_stuff, x = !!x_stuff)
lst(n = 4, x = !!x_stuff)
lst(!!!list(n = 2, x = x_stuff))
